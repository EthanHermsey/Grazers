Animated grazing creatures

A look into the life of these grazing creatures.
The main food source of these creatures are the flowers of a specific plant. Although this provides them with all the nutrients that they need, it also causes them to 
have terrible gas buildup inside their bodies. The gas makes them buoyant and in order to continue the main drive in their life, which is grazing [ยน], they have to 
fart and let the gas out.
They also love to hold hands and tickle each other, but hate it when they run into each other.

[ยน] Additional research is needed, some scientists say they are actually addicted to farting.
